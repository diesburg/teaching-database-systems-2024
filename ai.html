<h3>Full AI Statement</h3>
<p><i>--Written by Sarah Diesburg</i></p>
	
<p>AI is rapidly changing the face of software engineering.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are rapidly developing that can generate full programs based on a prompt (e.g. chatGPT and Bard) to being a "copilot" and suggesting lines of code as you are writing. These tools hold great promise to increase our productivity as programmers.</p>
	
<p>As software developers, we are tasked with the incredibly important job of making sure code we use or produce is correct, free from errors, and does not introduce security issues.  To properly use these AI tools in the future as professionals, we first need to understand how code works, inside and out.  Only once we understand how to code can we read, test, and properly evaluate code generated by AI tools.  Therefore, <b><i>the purpose of this class is to teach you how to fully understand the foundations of relational databases by creating your own schemas, diagrams, and code</i></b>.  </p>
	
<p>Further, nearly half of the points in this class will be evaluated on your abilities to read and write code in exam environments without access to an AI.  <b><i>If you can't generate and read SQL code yourself without the use of an AI, you will fail exams and the class.</i></b> You really have to know your stuff. </p>
	
<p>Towards the end of the class, I may allow the use of AI in specialized lab/project circumstances.  However, the general use of AI is not permitted unless given explicit permission.</p>
