<h1>Class Videos</h1>

	
<p>I try to take video recordings of my voice and my laptop screen during each lecture, but please note that <b><i>this is not an online class</i></b>.  Students do better with the material and earn higher grades by attending class in person.  Class videos will not include any information written on the board, any in-class activities, or allow you to participate or ask questions during the lecture.  That being said, these videos can be useful for you to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Free up your attention during class and use the videos to take notes later. </li>
		<li>Allow you to watch live coding in class and use the video to try the code later. </li>
		<li>Serve as a source of notes if you are sick or have an exception where you cannot come to class.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Class videos are only available to UNI students enrolled in the class.  You will need your CATID and Password to access them.  The class video link is below:</p>
